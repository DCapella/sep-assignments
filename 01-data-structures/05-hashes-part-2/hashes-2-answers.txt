Question: Describe three collision resolution strategies not mentioned here.
Answer:
  1. Linear Probing
    - Linear, goes through each one until it finds an empty cell.
  2. Double
    - Has two hashing functions.
    - When collision in one, checks the other then uses second function key to
      increment the first function key.
  3. Random
    - Uses random integer for key and on collision repeats until empty.


Question: Create your own collision resolution strategy and describe how it works.
Answer:
  Box - When collision happens, store second key, value pair as a branch of the
        first key, value pair.
