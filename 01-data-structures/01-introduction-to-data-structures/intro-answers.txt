1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate
the data?

  In 'line.rb', it allows developers to access and manipulate the data by letting them add,
remove and check the positions of the people through simple commands. In
'pixel.rb' and 'screen.rb', it allows access and manipulation by letting
developers create and color pixels including their sizes, as well as creating a
screen (which turns into a matrix) and adding pixels to it.

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure,
how would you search for it?

  A developer could find a specific element in my data structure by going to
specific class and looking for what they want it to do such as insert.

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

  Other real-world data that each structure can represent would be anything
that requires some sort of specific line (even numbers) such as a stack of
papers or a priority queue for a hospital for 'line.rb'. For 'screen.rb', that
would require coordinates or a matrix such as a dictionary or sorting as mail
per person.
